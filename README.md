   ### This repo consist of my intership task in LetsGrowMore Virtual Internship Program(LGMVIP)
##  Task List
 ### Task 1-Prediction using Supervised ML 
                                              (# level Beginner)
   - Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. 
   - This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
   - You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool 
   - Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data
   - What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day? 
                
        
  ### Task 2-Prediction using Unsupervised ML
                                          (Level - Beginner)
   - From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters 
     and represent it visually. 
   - Use R or Python or perform this task
   - Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
   
   
   
  ### Task 3-Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail
                                         (Level - Beginner)
   - Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’ 
   - As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can 
     work to make more profit. 
   - What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data? 
   - You can choose any of the tool of your choice 
     (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS) 
   - Dataset: https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl
   
  ### Task 4- Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism
                                       (Level - Intermediate)
   - Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’ 
   - As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism. 
   - What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA? 
   - You can choose any of the tool of your choice 
     (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS) 
   - Dataset: https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5

  ### Task 5-Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports
                                      (Level - Advanced)
   - Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Indian Premier League’ 
   - As a sports analysts, find out the most successful teams, players and factors 
     contributing win or loss of a team. 
   - Suggest teams or players a company should endorse for its products. 
   - You can choose any of the tool of your choice 
     (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS) 
   - Dataset: https://bit.ly/34SRn3b
   
  ### Task 6-Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm 
                                      (Level - Intermediate)
   - Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 
   - The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to 
      predict the right class accordingly.

 ### Task 7-Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis
                                     (Level - Advanced)
   - Objective: Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance  prediction
      using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental
      analysis of news headlines 
   - Stock to analyze and predict - SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX)
   - Download historical stock prices from https://finance.yahoo.com
   - Download textual (news) data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6
   - Use either R or Python, or both for separate analysis and then
